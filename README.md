# Code repo "news representation"
Accompanies paper "Deep news representations for macro finance". 

Implements pytorch versions of supervised autoencoder architectures (see
Le, L., Patterson, A., & White, M. (2018)) in the financial context of the paper.

sae_start.py as well as repr_nb.ipynb implement an example run.
