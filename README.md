# Code repo "news representation"
Accompanies paper "Deep news representations for macro finance". 

Implements pytorch versions of supervised autoencoder architectures (see
Le, L., Patterson, A., & White, M. (2018)) in the financial context of the paper.

sae_start.py as well as repr_nb.ipynb implement an example run for an example data set in the context of the paper.

utils folder contains the bulk of the code:
 
- data loaders
- loss functions
- models 
- sae class with train and test functionality
